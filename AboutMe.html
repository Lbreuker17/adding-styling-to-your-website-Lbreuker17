  <p>Hi, My name is Lesli Breuker and I am a senior in high school. I am dual enrolling to get a jumpstart on my college education. I want to major in Cybersecurity and maybe add a minor in IT.</p>

  <p>I love to read, listen to music, puzzle, and recently discovered that I like to cross stitch. My favorite book series are Percy Jackson, Divergent, Keeper of the Lost Cities, and The Hunger Games. I like to listen to Epic: The Musical on Spotify while I cross stitch and puzzle.</p>
